# Frog Leap Python

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the **Frog Leap Problem** solved using Python. The entire solution is documented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Copy_of_Frog_Leap_Problem_Statement.ipynb`), created using Google Colaboratory.

## üê∏ Problem Description

The Frog Leap problem is a well-known puzzle involving frogs positioned on a series of lily pads. Typically, there are two groups of frogs facing each other with an empty lily pad between them. The goal is for the frogs to swap their starting positions by following specific movement rules:

- Frogs can move one step forward to an adjacent empty pad.  
- Frogs can jump over exactly one frog onto an empty pad.  
- Frogs can only move in one direction (toward the opposite side).  
  
The challenge is to determine the sequence of valid moves that accomplishes this swap using the minimal number of moves.

## üéØ Objectives

- Model the Frog Leap puzzle state and moves programmatically.  
- Implement an algorithm to simulate frog moves while obeying puzzle constraints.  
- Find and display the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.  
- Demonstrate the solution for various initial configurations.
